A [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) filter list to block Friday Night Funkin' content and references on the web.

## Why?

Friday Night Funkin' is a questionable Flash rhythm game with a large amount of inappropriate content, gore, innuendos, and a very toxic fanbase. This filter list aims to help users avoid it.

Also I hate it, so there's that.

## Usage

Copy the link below, go to uBlock Origin > Dashboard > Filters and paste the link underneath the 'Import...' heading:
