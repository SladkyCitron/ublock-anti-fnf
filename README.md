A [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) filter list to block Friday Night Funkin' content and references on the web.

> [!WARNING]
> Aggresive filtering may break some pages (e.g. Newgrounds). This is intentional for a truly FNF-free experience.

## Why?

Friday Night Funkin' is a questionable Flash rhythm game with a large amount of inappropriate content, gore, innuendos, and a very toxic fanbase. This filter list aims to help users avoid it.

Also I hate the game, so there's that.
